From what I can recall, we had to develop a game around a topic related to something in our province or which affected students at our university. I may be misremembering though. This game ended up being a 2D game where you "battle" depression by avoiding abstract representations of depressing and pushing it backwards (to the left) by acquiring "powerups".

Created sometime around 2015-2019.
